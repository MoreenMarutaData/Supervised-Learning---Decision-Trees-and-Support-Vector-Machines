# Supervised-Learning-Decision-Trees-and-Support-Vector-Machines

Classifications
This repository contains the results and technical aspects of the Data Science Core IP at Moringa where Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. 
The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. It also contains necessary exercises and challenges i did to practise decision trees and support vector machines.

I used the healthcare datasets provided to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that a patient has hypothyroid or hyperthyroid.
The following approaches were used to achieve the objective.

Approach 1: Random forest classifier
Approach 2: Ada boost
Approach 3: Gradient boost
Approach 4: SVM - linear
Approach 5: SVM - Radial Basis Function
Approach 6: SVM - polynomial

I compared the accuracy and f1 scores for the above models and ranked them on how they perform.

The notebooks can be accessed above or through the link provided. Feel free to add comments.
