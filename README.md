# Supervised-Learning-Decision-Trees-and-Support-Vector-Machines

Classifications

This repository contains the results and technical aspects of the Data Science Core IP at Moringa where Nairobi Hospital conducted tests for hypothyroidism. 
The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. It also contains necessary exercises and challenges i did to practise decision trees and support vector machines.

I used the healthcare datasets provided to build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that a patient has hypothyroid or hyperthyroid.
The following approaches were used to achieve the objective.

* Approach 1: Random forest classifier
* Approach 2: Ada boost
* Approach 3: Gradient boost
* Approach 4: SVM - linear
* Approach 5: SVM - Radial Basis Function
* Approach 6: SVM - polynomial


The following packages were used
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* scipy
* Ipython
* pydotplus
* impyute

Built With
* Python3 - The python version used in collab
* Google Colab - google colab notebook

KNOWN BUGS There are no known bugs in the project.
